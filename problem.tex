The project can include:
\begin{itemize}\tightlist
  \item Nonlinear control of a cubesat
  \item Supervisory control system design
  \item Prototype design
  \item Test stand
  \item ...
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
  \item[Nonlinear Control:] A nonlinear control strategy is designet and verified through simulations and hopefully in the prototype.
  \item[Supervisory Control System:] A supervisory control strategy is proposed; when a cubesat satellite is operated, e.g. with several attitude sensitive payloads it might be beneficial to look into a method og optimising after e.g. the power budget which is often limited in a cubesat mission.
  \item[Prototype Design:] 
  \item[Test stand:] 
\end{description}
