\chapter{Introduction}
The development in the CubeSat industry demands increasing density of different technologies in a single unit CubeSat. This means elevated power consumption and maybe even higher demands for potential direction sensitive equipment like a camera, patch antenna or thrusters. 

Traditional methods of attitude control in CubeSats uses actuators like magnetorquers, reaction wheels and/or thrusters for stability and active pointing. Each kind of actuator has its own advantages and disadvantage when it comes to
