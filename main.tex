\chapter{Introduction}
The development in the CubeSat industry demands increasing density of different technologies in a single unit CubeSat. This means elevated power consumption and maybe even higher demands for potential attitude sensitive equipment like a camera, patch antennas or thrusters. 

Traditional methods of attitude control in CubeSats uses actuators like Magnetic Torquers, reaction wheels and/or thrusters for stability and active pointing. Each type of actuator has its own advantages and disadvantages as the level of power consumption relative to moment generation, density and complexity, each which makes them suited for different missions with a variety of control scenarios. The specifications of the actuators is also under the restrictions of the CubeSats volume and energy capacity which requires small and conservative actuators.

The Attitude Control System (ACS) for the CubeSat standard with the mentioned constrains, is vital to other systems in the CubeSat both is managing the attitude of the spacecraft but also constrained by a power budget, e.g. when the ACS is done actuating there has to be enough energy capacity to fulfil other objectives like transmitting data or using the payload.

Such an ACS should be aware of the spacecraft's objectives to come and their importances in order to optimise the required control manoeuvres and thereby the power consumption relative to the energy budget.
